\section{Authentication}

A Message Authentication Code (MAC) is used to verify the sender's identity. This means it affirms the message's origin. There are both hash-based and cipher-based implementations. The former calculate a unique code from the given message using a supplied key and hashing function, while the latter uses a cryptographic cipher to this end.\\

We decided to use the hash-based approach, because the ciphers introduce data dependencies between messages, which cannot be allowed in our implementation. Because we are working on a realtime audio streaming application, dropped packets are not really an issue. Because the audio is streamed, we cannot stop receiving and ask for a retransmit, as this would produce lag which is very annoying to the user.\\

Finally, we decided to use a hashing function from the SHA family. Both SHA-2 and SHA-3 (which is brand-new) are strong functions that do not yet have known vulnerabilities. During the implementation phase, we will select one of these functions based on performance.
