\section{Confidentiality}

\subsection{Overview}
High confidentiality is achieved by using a block cipher. The real time input stream is chopped into data blocks consisting of a fixed number of bits and then encrypted under a single symmetric key. Symmetric refers to the fact that the key is known to both the sending and the receiving DSP. The symmetric key is changed on every new session of data transmission. The symmetric key is negotiated using the Station-to-Station protocol which is based on exponential Diffie-Helman.



\section{Authentication}

A Message Authentication Code (MAC) is used to verify the sender's identity. This means it affirms the message's origin. There are both hash-based and cipher-based implementations. The former calculate a unique code from the given message using a supplied key and hashing function, while the latter uses a cryptographic cipher to this end.\\

We decided to use the hash-based approach, because the ciphers introduce data dependencies between messages, which cannot be allowed in our implementation. Because we are working on a realtime audio streaming application, dropped packets are not really an issue. Because the audio is streamed, we cannot stop receiving and ask for a retransmit, as this would produce lag which is very annoying to the user.\\

Finally, we decided to use a hashing function from the SHA family. Both SHA-2 and SHA-3 (which is brand-new) are strong functions that do not yet have known vulnerabilities. During the implementation phase, we will select one of these functions based on performance.
